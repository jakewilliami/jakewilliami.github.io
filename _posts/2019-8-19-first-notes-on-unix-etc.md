title: First Notes from a <code>UNIX</code>, <code>Git</code> and <code>R</code> Workshop
---

Though I had expressed in my first notebook, in late 2018 at nerve.fancy.chained, that I wanted to "learn terminal" (I obviously didn't know what "terminal" was...), and though I had used ample Excel over the summer of 2018--2019 working in Sue Schenk's lab., I didn't actually do any "proper" programming until relatively recently.

I only really went to it for <code>R</code>, but I am so glad I did.  I guess it was the push-start I needed.  After this, I talked to D. about <code>Git</code> and we ended up starting to make a Minecraft mod together.  The rest was history, I suppose.  I started using Julia in late September, 2019, after using Java with D. for a month or so.  Those were great times.  It was getting warmer, after August, and D. and I were still at university together.  We would come home and work on the mod, sometimes with a drink of Coke, and stay doing so till it was dark and we were hungry.  During that time, I did a <i>lot</i> of programming in <code>Bash</code>.  I created my [<code>scripts</code>](https://github.com/jakewilliami/scripts.git/) repository, which hosted all of these very buggy programmes written in bash.  It was in this playground where I also learned a little about other languages: namely <code>Perl</code>, <code>Ruby</code>, <code>Rust</code>, and <code>Python</code>.

Transcribed here are my initial notes from a workshop I went to at V.U.W. on <code>UNIX</code>, <code>Git</code>  and <code>R</code>.
