This machine is a Linux machine on IP `10.10.10.212`.

Running an `nmap` scan, we see two ports open:
```bash
$ nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.212

Just like Passage, we have an `ssh` and an `http` port open.  Let's have a look at the `http` port!

We will add the machine to our `hosts` file for ease of use:
```bash
echo "10.10.10.212 bucket" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

We go to `http://bucket:80`, which redirects us to `http://bucket.htb`, but we come to an error: `we can't connect to server at bucket.htb`, or `we're having trouble finding that site`.  Looking closer at the `nmap` output, we see that the `http-title` "Did not follow redirect".

Running a more comprehensive search or ports up to port number `65535` we find
```bash
$ sudo masscan -e tun0 -p1-65535 --rate=1000 10.10.10.212                                                         1 тип

So this isn't very different.  Let's try UDP scan:
```bash
$ sudo nmap -sUV -T4 10.10.10.212

Nothing here... (but it took a minute)!

After some searching on Linux forums, it looks like the problem might in fact be in my `hosts` file.  Changing
```bash
10.10.10.212 bucket
```
to
```bash
10.10.10.212 bucket.htb
```
fixed this issue.  This took me annoyingly long to figure out, but good to know!

It looks like the page is an advertising platform.  There are three main links at the top: `Home`, `About`, and `Feed`.  As usual, let's look at the page source!

The only thing of interest to me in the page source is that the server pulls (or attempts to pull) images from the following website:
```
http://s3.bucket.htb/adserver/images/
```

Though I can't seem to get to this website (via `ping` nor browser).













After a bit of searching, I found a tool to check what subdomains there might be with a given site.  This tool is called `gobuster`.  

I first tried it with the initial site:
```bash
$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -t 50 -e -u http://bucket.htb                               1 тип

Then I tried it with the image site:
