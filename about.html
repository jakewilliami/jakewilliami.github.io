  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
	I was born at the tender age of 0, but didn't enter into the world of tech till I was 21.  I got <a href="https://inphysecsecurity.com/">a job</a> in information/cyber security after completing a Bachelor of Science at <a href="https://www.vuw.ac.nz">Victoria University of Wellington</a> in 2020, where I majored in mathematics and psychology, and minored in chemistry.
  </p>
  <p>
    I spent the latter part of my degree teaching myself computer programming, integrating it into my studies where possible.  Of <a href="https://jakewilliami.github.io/posts/fumbling-with-julia-1-2-0">particular interest</a> was <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a>, which could be applied to the Sciences very well.  At the time I discovered programming (late August of 2019, after attending <a href="https://vuw-research-computing.github.io/2019-08-19-vuw/">a bash, git, and R workshop</a>), I spent a lot of time using <a href="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>, and would often be found on a weekend making <a href="https://jakewilliami.github.io/posts/creating-bootable-usb-drive">bootable installers</a> for very computers.  I also discovered <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> in early October of 2019, which (along with Julia) make up two of my most used languages.  At work I mostly use <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, but I maintain I am not a Python developer.  I am quite <a href="https://github.com/jakewilliami">active on GitHub</a>, and enjoy writing programmes (sometimes useless; primarily for my own edification).
  </p>
  <p>
    Since learning computer programming, I have worked on projects involving cryptography, data science, machine learning, and web devvelopment, in both academia and industry.  I am passionate about threat hunting, threat intelligence, digital forensicsm offensive security (with some experience in social engineering), and defensive security. I am working to improve my technical skills in all areas of security, and tech in general. 
  </p>
  <p>
    More of my broad range of interests include data science, anthropology, physics, linguistics, and biology.  Outside of academic interests, I enjoy writing, and listening to a broad range of music (including classical, jazz, and alt rock, and indie pop).  I am a tea-drinker, enjoy wearing suits, and chronically <a href="https://www.structuredprocrastination.com/">procrastinate structuredly</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am always learning, so if you have a piece of knowledge that you think I might like, or benefit from knowing, or have any feedback about anything I have written, please reach out!
