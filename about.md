Having studied Psychology, Mathematics, and Chemistry (at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand), I have recently been drawn to scientific computation.  I use Julia a lot, and write a lot of programmes (primarily for my own edification).  I am always learning, so take a look at [my GitHub](https://github.com/jakewilliami?tab=overview) and let me know if you think I can do better!

More of my broad range of interests include cybersecurity, datascience, anthropology, physics, linguistics, and biology.  I am a big tea-drinker, and enjoy wearing suits.
