I was born at the tender age of 0, but didn't enter into the world of tech till I was 21.  I got [a job](https://inphysecsecurity.com/) in information/cyber security after completing a Bachelor of Science at [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.vuw.ac.nz) in 2020, where I majored in mathematics and psychology, and minored in chemistry.

I spent the latter part of my degree teaching myself computer programming, integrating it into my studies where possible.  Of [particular interest](/fumbling-with-julia-1-2-0) was [Julia](https://julialang.org), which could be applied to the Sciences very well.  At the time I discovered programming (late August of 2019, after attending [a bash, git, and R workshop](https://vuw-research-computing.github.io/2019-08-19-vuw/)), I spent a lot of time using Linux, and would often be found on a weekend making [bootable installers](/creating-bootable-usb-drive) for very computers.  I also discovered [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) in early October of 2019, which (along with Julia) make up two of my most used languages.  At work I mostly use [Python](https://www.python.org/), but I maintain I am not a Python developer.  I try to remain somewhat [active on GitHub](https://github.com/jakewilliami), and enjoy writing programmes (sometimes useless; primarily for my own edification, or to [procrastinate](https://www.structuredprocrastination.com/)).

Since learning computer programming, I have worked on projects involving cryptography, data science, machine learning, and web devvelopment, in both academia and industry.  I am passionate about threat hunting, threat intelligence, digital forensics offensive security (with some experience in social engineering), and defensive security. I am working to improve my technical skills in all areas of security, and tech in general.  I still have a foot in the door in acedemia as I am currently persuing postgraduate education in psychology.

More of my broad range of interests include data science, anthropology, physics, linguistics, and biology.  Outside of academic interests, I enjoy writing, walking (but not running), and listening to a broad range of music (including classical, jazz, alt rock, and indie pop).  I am a tea-drinker, enjoy wearing suits.

I am always learning, so if you have a piece of knowledge that you think I might like, or benefit from knowing, or have any feedback about anything I have written, please reach out!
