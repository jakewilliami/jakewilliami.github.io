## Background

While living at G. Street from February, 2019&ndash;December, 2021, D. and I maintained what was originally a FreeNAS server, which upgraded to TrueNAS.  Upon moving to M. Tce in December last year, I paid D. out for the server components (which were bought together), and attempted to set it up at my new place.  Some months of troubleshooting went by...I assumed, having the same static public IP address and the same router, that the server would just work, but alas.  When I plugged it in, it worked, but Plex thought it was outside of the home network&mdash;possibly something to do with Traeffic and PiHole (which D. had set up).  So I tried to fix this and got to the point where the computer couldn't even connect to the router, to which it was plugged in.  I ended up reinstalling TrueNAS to start from scratch.  This allowed me to a) have a clean install, and b) gain more individual experience setting it up.

## (Re)Installing TrueNAS

## Setting DHCP Reservation

## Allowing SSH Access

If your setup is anything like mine, I do not have my server plugged into any convenient display.  Hence, setting up SSH access to your server now will help if you are required to troubleshoot and do not have access to the web portal in any of the following steps.

## Account Set-up

## Installing qBittorrent

## Installing Plex

## Viewing the System Log
