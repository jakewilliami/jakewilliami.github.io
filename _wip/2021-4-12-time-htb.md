We go to `http://time` and find an online JSON beautifier and validator.  Cool!  My first thought: I wonder how it validates it?  Does it run something?  I also recall that [you can use JSON instead of HTML](https://twitter.com/tsoding/status/1357636127184855040).  

I input `{"key":"val"}` and it indents it nicely.  Using Burp Suite, it seems to use a POST call, with these body parameters:
```
mode=1&data=%7B%22key%22%3A%22val%22%7D
```

I now try the Beautify option (which is in Beta) and these are the body parameters:
```
mode=2&data=%7B%22key%22%3A%22val%22%7D
```

This, however, gives the following error:
```
Validation failed: Unhandled Java exception: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException: Unexpected token (START_OBJECT), expected START_ARRAY: need JSON Array to contain As.WRAPPER_ARRAY type information for class java.lang.Object
```

Using some basic attack methods using the Intruder tab in Burp Suite, it seems that any other `mode` number will default to `mode=1`.

Changing the body parameters to 
```
mode=1&data={"key":"val"}
```

gives the same output (as with `mode=2`), so we don't need to encode our query.

Trying to give it an array (`["key":"val"]`) does not work (it is invalid to the Beautifier, as it returns `null`).

I search the aforementioned error and find [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26251486/jackson-polymorphic-deserialization-expected-start-array).  If I append this search with `"exploit"` I find [this](https://swapneildash.medium.com/understanding-insecure-implementation-of-jackson-deserialization-7b3d409d2038).
